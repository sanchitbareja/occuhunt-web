Hi {{name}}!

We're Sanchit and Sidwyn, the founders of Occuhunt.

To make sure you're started off on the right foot, we'd like to give you some recommendations:
1) Upload your resume here (http://occuhunt.com/showcase/). This is your personal showcase page and you can choose who it is visible to. By default, it is only visible to you.
2) Check out upcoming info sessions and career fairs on your campus here (http://occuhunt.com/events/) on our Discover tab.
3) Begin dropping your resumes! Hover over any company at the career fair, and click on the circle to drop your resume. Once done, you can begin managing your applications here (http://occuhunt.com/plan/companies/).

Bonus: If you need help with your resumes, feel free to upload it on the resume feed (http://occuhunt.com/plan/resume-feed/) to get feedback.

With that, we're absolutely excited to have you on Occuhunt. You can shoot us an email here, text or call to 510-612-7328, and we'll be happy to help you out!
Thanks for using Occuhunt!

Cheers,
Sanchit and Sidwyn
Founders
